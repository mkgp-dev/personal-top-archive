    <p>In Tagalog, sinangag translates to “garlic fried rice,” and it’s exactly as it sounds: rice fried with a generous amount of garlic, salt, and pepper. Sinangag is often combined with itlog, meaning “egg,” creating the popular Filipino breakfast silog.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>8 cloves garlic, divided</p></li>
      <li><p>3 cups cold cooked jasmine rice</p></li>
      <li><p>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p></li>
      <li><p>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed</p></li>
      <li><p>3 tablespoons canola or neutral oil, divided, plus more</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Thinly slice 4 garlic cloves, and mince the remaining 4 garlic cloves.</p></li>
      <li><p>Place 3 cups cold cooked jasmine rice in a large bowl and break up any large clumps with your hands. Season the rice with the minced garlic, 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt, and 3/4 teaspoon of the black pepper, and toss to evenly coat the rice.</p></li>
      <li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons of the canola oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic slices and cook, stirring, until the edges just begin to turn golden, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil. Add the seasoned rice and toss until well coated in the garlic oil, about 1 minute. Spread the rice across the surface of the pan and cook undisturbed until a light golden crust forms on the bottom and the garlic pieces are mostly golden-brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir and turn off heat. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed. Serve with your favorite protein and fried eggs.</p></li>
