    <p>When I was younger, I used to sneak into the kitchen and open the refrigerator to eat spoonfuls of Mango Royale. I remember always asking my mom to make it because I enjoyed eating a cold dessert that wasn’t just ice cream. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized just how easy it is to make myself. Once assembled, the hardest part is letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight — but I’d say it’s worth the wait.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>6 ripe large yellow mangoes, such as Carabao, Ataulfo, or Champagne (about 2 3/4 pounds)</p></li>
      <li><p>22 full-size sheets graham crackers (about 12 ounces), divided</p></li>
      <li><p>2 cups cold heavy cream</p></li>
      <li><p>2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk</p></li>
      <li><p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p></li>
      <li><p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Peel, pit, and dice 6 ripe large yellow mangoes (about 2 1/3 cups). Place 2 sheets of the graham crackers in a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin into crumbs (about 1/3 cup).</p></li>
      <li><p>Beat 2 cups cold heavy cream in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on medium speed until soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon kosher salt on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Line the bottom of an 8x8-inch square baking dish with a single, tight layer of graham crackers, breaking them as needed to fit (about 5 sheets). Top with 1 1/4 cups of the cream mixture and spread into an even layer. Top evenly with 1/4 of the mango (about 1/2 cup). Repeat layering the graham crackers, cream mixture, and mango three more times. Sprinkle evenly with the graham cracker crumbs.</p></li>
      <li><p>Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight before serving. Cut into 9 to 12 pieces, wiping the knife between each cut for the cleanest-looking slices.</p></li>
    </ol>
