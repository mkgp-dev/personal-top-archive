    <p>Bola-bola can be served a number of ways. You can pile them onto a platter and serve them with an assortment of dipping sauces (sweet chili sauce and spiced vinegar are my faves), tuck them into buns or pandesal (Filipino rolls), throw some onto a rice bowl for lunch, or keep it super casual and plate them up with frozen french fries. Whatever you do, these meatballs will always hit the spot.</p>

      <li><p>1 small yellow onion</p></li>
      <li><p>1 medium carrot</p></li>

      <li><p>1 large egg</p></li>
      <li><p>1 tablespoon soy sauce</p></li>
      <li><p>2 teaspoons fish sauce</p></li>
      <li><p>2 teaspoons oyster sauce</p></li>
      <li><p>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</p></li>
      <li><p>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p></li>
      <li><p>2 cups neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable, for frying</p></li>
      <li><p>Sweet chili sauce, for serving</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Grate 1 small yellow onion (1/4 cup) on the large holes of a box grater into a large bowl. Peel and grate 1 medium carrot (3/4 cup) and 3 garlic cloves on the small holes of the box grater into the bowl. Add 1 pound ground pork, 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs, 1 large egg, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 teaspoons fish sauce, 2 teaspoons oyster sauce, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Mix together with your hands until evenly combined.</p></li>
      <li><p>Scoop out the mixture in 2-tablespoon portions (about 22 meatballs) and roll between damp hands until a smooth ball forms. Place on a large plate.</p></li>
      <li><p>Heat 2 cups neutral oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat until 350ÂºF, about 8 minutes. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack and/or paper towels. Fry 10 to 12 meatballs at a time: Using tongs, add to the hot oil and fry, flipping halfway through, until cooked through and golden-brown all over, 5 to 6 minutes total. Transfer to the rack or paper towels. Serve with sweet chili sauce alongside for dipping and cooked white rice if desired.</p></li>
